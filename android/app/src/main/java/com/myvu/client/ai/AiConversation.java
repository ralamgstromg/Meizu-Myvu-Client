/**
 * The AI assistant, driven by the GLASSES' microphone.
 *
 * The glasses record audio themselves and stream it to the phone as code:109
 * Opus packets; the phone is expected to recognise it and send captions back.
 * That is why there is no SpeechRecognizer here -- it cannot be fed an audio
 * stream below API 33, and the audio is not ours to begin with.
 *
 * The glasses stream CONTINUOUSLY once the assistant is open -- silence
 * included -- so the packet stream carries no end-of-speech signal. Packets are
 * therefore decoded as they arrive and end-of-speech is found by measuring
 * audio energy, which is what the official app does with its native VAD
 * (VadDetector, feeding 512-byte chunks with a 600ms pause).
 *
 * THE ORDER BELOW IS THE PROTOCOL. The glasses run real timers:
 *   code:4            immediately, before any slow work (arms an 8s timeout)
 *   code:104 type:1   on the first audio packet -- the only thing that clears it
 *   code:104 type:2   when the audio stops
 *   code:101 type:0   growing partials, so the caption builds instead of flashing
 *   code:101 type:1   final caption
 *   code:106 (7)      VR_PROCESSION, AFTER the caption or the glasses drop it
 *   code:5 -> 6/1 -> audio -> 6/2 -> 107
 *
 * THREADING: TextToSpeech is looper-affine, so this lives on the main thread.
 * Decoding and the network calls run on a worker; sends hop to the connection
 * thread inside the sender.
